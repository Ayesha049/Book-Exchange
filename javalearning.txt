SOME TIPS

Always try to declare all fields as private.

Create a constructor that accepts those private fields as inputs.

Create a public method that sets each private field, this way you will know when you are changing a field. These methods are called setters.

Create a public method that returns each private field, so you can read the value without mistakingly changing it. These methods are called getters.

**************************

Set all your classes to public.

Set all your fields to private.

Set any of your methods to public that are considered actions.

Set any of your methods to private that are considered helper methods.
