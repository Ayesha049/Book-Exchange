This : is the reference to current object in a class

Java default access modifier is public

SOME TIPS

Always try to declare all fields as private.

Create a constructor that accepts those private fields as inputs.

Create a public method that sets each private field, this way you will know when you are changing a field. These methods are called setters.

Create a public method that returns each private field, so you can read the value without mistakingly changing it. These methods are called getters.

**************************

Set all your classes to public.

Set all your fields to private.

Set any of your methods to public that are considered actions.

Set any of your methods to private that are considered helper methods.

file scanner

File file = new File("text file name");
Scanner fileScanner = new Scanner(file);

Exception : Another option is to simply catch ALL exception types by catching the general type Exception, this means that whatever exception is thrown within this try-catch block, it will be caught and handled in this catch statement

polymorphism : You are allowed to use the parent's data type when declaring a child variable. But to use the parent's constructor you will need to cast the variable before assigning it to the child's data type.

super : You are allowed to re-use the parent method in the child class by using the "super" keyword, followed by a dot and then the method name

You can also use super() to call the parent's constructor. This is usually done when implementing the child's constructor. Typically you would want to first run everything in the parent's constructor then add more code in the child's constructor.
If a child's constructor does not explicitly call the parent's constructor using super, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the default constructor of the parent class. If the parent class does not have a default constructor, you will get a compile-time error
